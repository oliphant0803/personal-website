summary: Poster presentation
abstract: 'Software development constitutes a collaborative process that hinges on effective cooperation between Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and User Experience Designers (UXDs). Particularly in the early phase of the development lifecycle, SDEs and UXDs work together closely to elicit software requirements and designs. While previous studies have shed light on collaboration challenges and potential solutions between SDEs and UXDs, few studies cover the entire process of SE and UX collaboration, and most of them focus only on agile development. The goal of our study is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the collaboration scenarios and challenges faced by SDEs and UXDs, as well as to propose a set of good practices to address the identified pain points. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review on existing papers and a grey literature review on online SE & UX forums and the VS Code project on GitHub, using open coding to summarize challenges and good practices. During the systematic literature review, we initially screened 9414 papers from five databases using keyword search strings. After two rounds of selection, we narrowed down the focus to 41 papers for qualitative analysis using open coding. 5 key challenges of UX and SE collaboration and 7 good practices were identified. Our findings have broad applicability, extending beyond agile development to traditional and open-source software development as well. The proposed good practices can also serve as a guide for future studies, facilitating the creation of specific collaboration tools for SDEs and UXDs.'
